Let’s consider the following problem - we want to implement a secure portal, within which users should be confident that 
no personal information or any other identifying information will be stored and therefore cannot be given to or 
illegally obtained/stolen by third parties or organizations. 
Let’s examine the problem from the perspective of the owner of such a portal.

We start with the basics - first of all, users should not save any such information in their profiles or upload it 
to the portal in any other way, but this is a matter of user OpSec, and not a responsibility of the portal owner.

Secondly, as we mentioned, all interactions are carried out using certificates/mTLS, which means that each user will 
have a trusted certificate. Accordingly, the process of issuing certificates/signing CSRs, however it may be implemented, 
should not leave any logs or traces. Thus, we eliminate information about how many certificates are in existence, 
what these certificates are, and what their public keys are.

Thirdly, if we do not possess information about user certificates, as we intentionally do not store it anywhere, we can 
still authenticate based on the Root CA; however, the question arises here - how to implement authorization, that is, to 
match the data obtained during authentication with what is stored in our system, e.g., userId.

As already noted, we cannot store the direct relation between certificate-userId or public key-userId in our database, 
as in the event of its compromise, this information would leak and could subsequently be matched with specific users 
based on them being in possession of their certificates. Since we cannot store this correspondence explicitly, the idea 
of algorithmically forming such a UserId from the authentication data arises.

### 1. Let’s list the goals we would like to achieve with this approach:

1. Minimal interaction with authentication data on the protocol, minimizing the risk of leaking authentication tokens.
   - In this case, tokens are user certificates and public keys.
   - On the protocol, we want to use them very quickly at the connection initialization stage and then forget them 
forever until the next authentication.
   - And we definitely do not want to persist them anywhere at the level of our portal, in any database, logs, etc.
2. It should be impossible to directly compute authentication data from the data we store on the portal
   - That is, from the authentication data (certificate), our portal can compute UserId, but not vice versa.
   - Thus, if we leak UserId, it should not be trivial to match it to the certificate.
3. Replay attacks on authentication shouldn't be possible
4. With a known user certificate and its keys, it should not be possible to compute UserId without full access to the 
portal's secrets.
    - From the authentication data (certificate), our portal can compute UserId, but only our portal can do this, and 
no other actor, not even the users themselves.
5. The certificate, or rather its pair of keys, must correspond to one and only one UserId.

### 2. Having defined these goals, we can propose the following solution in the form of a protocol and an algorithm for 
computing UserId on the portal side.

1. Initialize an mTLS session, as usual.
    - In this process, we obtain the user’s certificate, which is checked for trustworthiness through the Root CA in a 
standard manner.
2. Challenge the user - for example, to sign something random.
    - This step is optional, as something similar already happens at the mTLS level.
    - We just want to explicitly mention this point, as this serves as protection against replay attacks.
3. Then the user sends us a `secret packet` - their public key, encrypted with their private key.
    - The portal can verify this secret by decrypting it with the public key, resulting in the same public key.
4. If all checks pass, the server concatenates, XORs, or otherwise merges the `secret packet` and the `portal secret`.
    - The SHA-256 of the result of this operation is computed.
    - Even better, run it through PBKDF2 a secret number of iterations.
5. The result of step 4 is your UserId.

### 3. Let’s consider how this approach achieves the above goals.
1. Minimal interaction with authentication data on the protocol
    - After computing the UserId, we can completely remove the certificate from memory. For authorized and secure 
communication, just the TLS AES key and the computed UserId are sufficient.
2. It should be impossible to directly compute authentication data from the data we store on the portal
    - Since we do not persist public keys or certificates (including logs) and at the initialization of each connection, 
they must be destroyed immediately after authorization, even in RAM, the leakage of this data from the portal's storage 
is impossible.
    - In the event of a complete compromise of the portal and interception of all control, of course, this data could 
be intercepted over time from new sessions, but there is nothing to be done if the portal is fully compromised.
    - In this case, however, we are not talking about something serious, like the leakage of email or phone numbers, 
but about certificates and public keys, which in itself represents minimal risk, and they are very easy (and even 
necessary) to change regularly.
3. Replay attacks on authentication shouldn't be possible
    - Although the user’s `secret packet` could theoretically be stolen, albeit with great difficulty, and then reused, 
steps 1 and 2 prevent the possibility of replay attacks without a complete compromise of the user’s keys.
4. With a known user certificate and its keys, it should not be possible to compute UserId
    - Since in step 4 we modify the `secret packet`, combining it with `portal secret` before computing the UserId, it 
follows that to repeat the computation of UserId, one must also know the `portal secret`, which is known only to the 
portal.
5. The certificate must correspond to one and only one UserId.
   - A stable encryption mode should be used, in which the ciphertext is constant, such as in RSA encryption with a 
private key.

> Why is a `secret packet` needed, and can we simply use client's public key instead?

The point in using a `secret packet` is that there are far fewer ways to obtain it than simply the client's public key. 
For example, when using an MITM attack and observing TLS traffic, certificates with the client's public keys can be 
intercepted. Moreover, the public key is meant to be shared, and for various reasons, even aside from hacking, the 
client may willingly choose to publish it. Furthermore, since the public key is easier to obtain, if an attacker 
compromises the portal and the `portal secret`, along with the list of UserIds, they could quickly check against a 
previously collected database of public keys to see if any match the users of the portal.

If a `secret packet` is used, however, then such quick analysis by the attacker becomes impossible. Thus, it provides a 
stronger guarantee that it is not possible to form a UserId with only the `portal secret`, even if the attacker has 
access to potentially open or leaked data, such as the user's public key.

Using a `secret packet` ensures that to associate a certificate with a UserId, both the `portal secret` and the user's 
`secret packet` must be known. Given that both the user's public and private keys are required to form this packet, 
or in the simplest case for the attacker, the time and effort to analyze incoming connections after compromising 
the portal, the attacker will at least have to spend additional time and effort to hack/track both sides. Therefore, 
large-scale offline automated matching of keys and users doesn't become possible even if portal data is compromised.
