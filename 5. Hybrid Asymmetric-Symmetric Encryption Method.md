## Hybrid Asymmetric-Symmetric Encryption Method

As is known, many asymmetric algorithms can only encrypt a limited amount of data. 
For example, RSA-2048 encrypts 245 bytes of plaintext, resulting in 256 bytes of ciphertext.

However, it's often desirable to encrypt data larger than 245 bytes, such as long texts, files, etc. 
In addition, the performance of symmetric ciphers, such as AES-256, is often better than that of 
asymmetric ciphers, such as RSA. This is why network protocols (e.g., mTLS) use symmetric encryption for 
traffic, employing asymmetric primitives only during the handshake phase.

I tried to find a standard for encrypting strings, BLOBs, or files in this way, but found nothing. 
Therefore, I decided to invent my own standard, as simple as I could come up with. I present it below.

See the figure:

As can be seen from the image, the plaintext in this case is encrypted using a symmetric cipher, while the symmetric 
key is encrypted using an asymmetric key and stored in the header.

- The first 4 bytes are a `uint32` in `Big Endian` format representing the size in bytes of the encrypted symmetric key;
- then come the bytes of the encrypted symmetric key itself; 
- everything that remains is the ciphertext, encrypted with the symmetric key.
