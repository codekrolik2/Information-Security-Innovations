Reverse Service Authentication in Vault / K8s
---
Vault has a feature called Kubernetes authentication, which is the foundation of technologies like the Vault Agent Sidecar
Injector and the broader ecosystem of how secrets are retrieved from Vault and injected into containers at init time.

This approach works, but only for pulling secrets. If we pull something from somewhere—especially if someone manually
generated and stored it—there’s a high chance that those secrets were already stolen before we even got them, for
example, by a specially trained Google expert with a backdoor into your GKE and Chrome.

Thus, the only things that should ever be pushed or pulled are public keys (typically in the form of certificates), and even
then, with extreme caution.

Now, if our service is not just a simple proxy moving requests back and forth but an actual service doing useful work,
then it’s not the service that needs secrets—rather, its secrets are needed by those who want to access it. For such a
service, it would be foolish to require an admin to set a password, share it everywhere, and expose it to theft and MITM
attacks. Instead, the service should generate its own certificate, share only the public key, and accept traffic exclusively
over TLS. Determining who is allowed to send traffic is a separate discussion.

This approach effectively results in "reverse" authentication or "reverse" secret distribution. Instead of a service obtaining
compromised tokens of unclear origin, it instead publishes its public key—generated at init time and, at least initially,
uncompromised. The challenge is not how to generate it or even how to prevent its compromise in the cloud (which is an
issue but outside this discussion); rather, the real question is how to publish it securely. After all, if a cybercriminal can
swap the published key with their own, they can once again enable MITM attacks.

Vault Agent is irrelevant here—it can only pull text-based junk from Vault, which is no longer viable in 2025. Just discard
the Agent and never use it. However, Kubernetes auth is useful, as it allows us to authenticate in Vault via a client. Vault
itself is not useless—only the secrets naïve users upload to it are, since those were stolen long before they even reached
Vault. Assuming the Kubernetes auth mechanism works as intended (otherwise, this whole approach is impossible), we
can leverage it to store our public key in Vault at an unpredictable moment—during the container’s creation and
initialization—catching potential attackers off guard. Now, the key is in Vault, and since we only have permission to create
(not update), even if an attacker intercepts Kubernetes JWTs, it’s too late—the publish action is already done (TODO:
verify this in practice).

The next step is ensuring that authorized clients can retrieve this key, along with additional metadata like service
discovery info, IPs, etc., all signed, of course. Clients authenticate to Vault, using certificates—not just any certificates
that criminals can steal as easily as plaintext password files from a desktop, but PKCS#11-backed certificates. Since Vault
clients are funded by certain "interested parties," they predictably do not support PKCS#11 (requesting support is
pointless—they will just tell you it's outdated and that the trendy approach is to hand over all your secrets to them). So,
this must be done via the REST API.

Since we have planned everything carefully, this operation involves a wrapped token. If an attacker somehow intercepts
it inside Vault, they get nothing, and we trigger a nuclear strike on the container before it can even be used. But if we
retrieve the token, then the attacker gets nothing—making Vault a critical piece of this scheme.

Now, in an ideal world, we securely obtain the real key from our service, and it has not been tampered with by
cybercriminals, meaning MITM attacks are no longer feasible. We must start using the key before it gets cracked by a
quantum processor or before our container is compromised. Since we have a client-side PKCS#11 certificate, our service
will reject mass port-scanning cyber-thugs because it recognizes our cert before installation and enforces mTLS, like all
infection-free systems. However, this setup is only a temporary measure—it must be regularly updated by rotating
certificates and deploying new services. This could be done every minute or every connection, though that's impractical.
A reasonable approach must be found—Istio, for instance, rotates certificates daily.
