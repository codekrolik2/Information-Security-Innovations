Practical Use of Shamir's Algorithm for Service Initialization in the Spirit of HashiCorp Vault with PKCS#11 Support for Enhanced Security
---
One Possible Approach

1. We define the following entities:
   1. Shamir Key
   2. Intermediate Key (AES-256) + IV
   3. Init Admin’s Certificate
2. Generate Shamir Keys in the process of secure storage initialization. Keep them local and private.
3. For each Shamir Key, generate a corresponding Intermediate AES-256 Key and IV.
   1. Encrypt the Shamir Keys using their respective Intermediate Keys and IVs.
   2. Store the encrypted Shamir Keys alongside our secure storage.
4. Assign each Intermediate AES-256 Key to a specific Init Admin, linked to their public key.
   1. Encrypt each Intermediate AES-256 Key using the corresponding Init Admin's public key.
   2. Store the encrypted Intermediate Keys and IVs alongside our secure storage.
   3. Also, store the public keys for reference.

Unsealing Process

1. A quorum of Init Admins retrieves the encrypted Intermediate Keys (ideally should possible in sealed state only).
2. Each Init Admin decrypts their assigned Intermediate Key using their private key and returns it to the Vault.
3. The Vault receives the decrypted Intermediate Keys, then uses them along with their IVs to decrypt the Shamir Keys.
4. Using Shamir’s Algorithm, the master key is reconstructed.
5. The system is unsealed.
6. If necessary, rotate all Intermediate Keys (since they have been exposed and could be compromised) and re-encrypt the Shamir Keys.
